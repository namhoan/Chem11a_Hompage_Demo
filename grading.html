   Grading:
   </h1>
   <h2 style="font-style: Times New Roman; font-size:12pt;">
   Grades will be calculated as follows: <br>
   4 Quizzes           20% <br>
   2  exams          40% <br>
   Final exam          40% <br>

   The average grade in Chem. 11a is generally around B-.  Letter-grade <br>equivalences to numerical scores are usually determined based on the <br>class average and the distribution of scores. <br>

   Performing well in the course, however, should not be a competition <br>with your fellow students.  The following table provides guaranteed <br>letter-grade equivalences for any student whose performance falls   <br>within a specified range.<br>
   Any curve can only help, it cannot hurt, your grade.  For example, if <br> the average final score is 62%, that score will be set as the B-  and all <br> other grades will be adjusted around that average.  On the other hand, <br> if the class average is 82%, that does not mean that 82% is now equivalent<br> to a B-.  Rather, it means that the average grade earned in the class would be B+.<br>
