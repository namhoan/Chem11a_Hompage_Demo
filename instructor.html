<h2 style="font-size: 20;">Profile <br>
My own love of learning awakened in me a passion for teaching that dates back to my own years as an undergraduate student. I have studied many diverse subjects, completing undergraduate degrees in Russian Language and Literature and Vocal Performance before pursuing a doctoral degree in Slavic Linguistics. Singing led me to teaching voice and returning to school to complete the post-baccalaureate premedical program led me to teaching chemistry. While I had aspired to applying to veterinary school, at some point it became clear to me that I was ignoring the path that was illuminated in fluorescent lights before me--learning was what I loved and teaching enabled me to continue to learn and allowed me to share that passion with others. <br>
In my courses, I help students become skilled at breaking down problems and at applying familiar tools in unfamiliar contexts. Most of the students who pass through General Chemistry will not be professional scientists. Many will soon explore and find other academic loves. It is my hope, however, that all the students who spend time in my classroom learn something about themselves, discover their own strengths and passions, and develop permanent skills that will take them, confidently, far beyond the topic of chemistry into anything they choose to pursue.
