   <h2>
Chemistry 11a covers a wide array of topics, embracing aspects of descriptive, as well as quantitative, chemistry.  No prior study of chemistry is assumed, as the course begins by looking at the atomic foundation of matter, the elements, and the organization of the Periodic Table, working its way up to an examination of how atoms are bonded together to form larger units of matter.  Students who complete this course will have an understanding of the three major phases of matter solids, liquids, and gases and how they behave, as well as a knowledge of the major types of chemical reactions and how to represent them.  A strong focus is put on learning methods of creative problem solving using the material as a way to develop creative approaches to solving unfamiliar problems skill that carries students far beyond the confines of the classroom.
